# NewbieEdDesignCompetition2020

Here lies all the code that will be used in the Newbie Ed for the Design Competition 2020.

# Day 1

1) Clone this repository and create a new branch (Name it as FirstnameLastname, fill in your name of course, Ex: PakMingLau)
2) Checkout your branch and open Dog.java in your folder with VSCode
3) Create a constructor that takes in no inputs and sets the name to Fred, breed to Husky, age to 3, and rabies to false;
4) Create a method with the header `public void age()` which increments the dog's age by one.
5) Create a method with the header `public int getAge()` which returns the age of the dog
6) Create a method with the header `public int getAgeInDogYears()` which returns the age of the dog in dog years
7) Create a method with the header `public boolean hasRabies()` that returns whether or not the dog has rabies.
8) Create a method with the header `public void setRabies(boolean gotRabies)` that sets `rabies` to `gotRabies`
9) In the main method, create a dog object using the default constructor and have it bark, print out its age, and give it rabies.
10) In the main method, create a dog whose name is bar, who is a dachschund, and is 1 year old. Print out its age in dog years and whether or not it has rabies.
11) `git add -A` and `git commit -m` and then `git push`. **From Renee: Make your commit messages pretty**
12) Create a pull request to merge to master.

**Optional**

Create a new branch and name it FirstnameLastname1 (Ex: PakMingLau1).
- Create an interface called Animal
    - Add a method called makeNoise(), run(), eat(). (These methods could have parameters and are missing return types, use your best judgement)
